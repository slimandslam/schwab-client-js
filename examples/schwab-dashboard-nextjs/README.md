## This dashboard uses NextJS, Tailwind, and Recharts to stream real-time market data from Schwab and display it in your web browser

### **schwab-client-js** gives you complete access to the Schwab REST API using convenient classes and methods. You can stream real-time market data, create and track orders, and retrieve information about your account as well as retrieve different types of market data.

## Installation

**Software prerequisites: nodejs version 18 or newer and a package manager such as yarn or npm**

```
npm install

or

yarn
```

You'll need to create the `.env` file as described in the schwab-client-js instructions.
If you don't have a working SCHWAB_REFRESH_TOKEN, you can run `schwab-authorize` to create one.
See the schwab-client-js instructions.

## Usage

```
yarn dev

or

npm run dev
```

Those commands will run NextJS and then try to open the frontend in your default web browser.
The dashboard uses SSE (Server-Sent Events) to send the data from NextJS to the web browser.
You can change the stock ticker symbol by editing the file: `app/api/market-stream/route.js`

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
